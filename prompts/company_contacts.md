Find me the best 1 to 3 contacts leading projects in Earth Observation, GIS, and Geospatial, as we want their expertise and opinions to help us build the Earth Observation platform.

For companies that couldn't find contacts related to GIS, geospatial, and Earth observation, try to find contacts in the 'innovation' departments that are focused on technology and business applications.

With the contacts collect the requested fields:

Inferred Email: If the email is not found, generate a plausible email address based on the typical email structure of other addresses at their company.
