Hi [Name],

At Lufthansa we are considering entering the Earth Observation industry with a solution that will offer low-cost, high resolution and high revisit ratio data.

**In short**, we are looking forward to getting your perspective on how to improve the actual available Earth Observation data products, so we can refine together our value proposition. Are you available for a short call (30 minutes max) to discuss?

Thank you very much in advance, and best regards from Berlin,

Fernando
