You are interested in the projects they are working on in relation to geospatial imagery.

You want to understand their needs and explore how we can offer a better solution to their challenges.

Write a short, concise email, max 4–5 paragraphs.

Find some projects their company is working on. Propose potential applications where our imagery could be beneficial.

Make it very clear that we are reaching out from the innovation arm of Lufthansa, called the Lufthansa Innovation Hub.

Include our tagline:

"Lufthansa is transforming aerial observation: daily, high-resolution imagery spanning 95% of Germany and 50% of Europe, with industry-leading 50 cm GSD—delivered at the lowest price per km²."

Note: We are currently in the process of spinning out this business and are reaching out to potential partners who could benefit from shaping the solution with us.

Approach with genuine curiosity about their challenges—this is not a sales pitch.

If the person is not the right contact, ask them to kindly redirect us to the correct one.

Use soft, formal, professional language.

We are asking for a 30-minute conversation.

Suggest a subject line that builds trust and curiosity, and includes Lufthansa.

Call to Action: ask if they are open to a short call.

For each contact, generate a plausible email address by inferring it from the public email structure of other addresses at their company.
