My name is Fernando, and I work as a Senior Venture Developer at the Lufthansa Innovation Hub in Berlin. We are developing a new Earth Observation data product by leveraging the Lufthansa Group aircraft fleet. The product enables high-frequency optical and thermal image capabilities across Europe — building on Lufthansa’s extensive flight network to provide consistent, wide-area, low cost coverage for Geospatial imagery applications.

At this time, our goal is to better understand the Earth Observation data needs of Europe’s leading utilities, and how such data can create value, for example, [ADD HERE EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION OF GEOSPATIAL IMAGERY THAT ARE RELEVANT FOR THEIR COMPANY].

Thank you very much in advance, and best regards from Berlin,

Fernando
