## Exploring Potential Collaboration with Lufthansa Innovation Hub on Geospatial Imagery
Dear Mr. Guillén Suárez,

I am reaching out from the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, the innovation arm of Lufthansa, where we are actively transforming aerial observation. Our project delivers daily, high-resolution imagery covering 95% of Germany and 50% of Europe, with an industry-leading 50 cm ground sample distance (GSD), all at the lowest price per km². We are currently in the process of spinning this initiative out and exploring partnerships to co-frame solutions that bring tangible value.

Given Lufthansa’s strong aviation presence and your leadership, I am genuinely curious about the geospatial imagery projects Lufthansa is undertaking or planning. Understanding your current challenges and needs would help us explore how our data could support applications such as real-time aviation infrastructure monitoring, environmental impact assessment, or operational efficiency improvements—areas where precise, frequent aerial data can make a significant difference.

If you are not the appropriate contact for these topics, I would appreciate if you could kindly direct me to the relevant colleague. Otherwise, I would be grateful for 30 minutes of your time for a brief call to learn more about Lufthansa’s geospatial needs and to discuss potential collaborative opportunities.

Please let me know if you are open to a short conversation.

Kind regards,

[Your Full Name]

Lufthansa Innovation Hub
